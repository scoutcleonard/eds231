```{r packages}
library(here)
library(pdftools)
library(quanteda)
library(tm)
library(topicmodels)
library(ldatuning)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(reshape2)

```

Load the data

```{r data}
##Topic 6 .Rmd here:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaRo406/EDS_231-text-sentiment/main/topic_6.Rmd
#grab data here: 
comments_df<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaRo406/EDS_231-text-sentiment/main/dat/comments_df.csv")

#comments_df <- read_csv(here("dat", "comments_df.csv")) #if reading from local
```

Now we'll build and clean the corpus

```{r corpus}
epa_corp <- corpus(x = comments_df, text_field = "text")
epa_corp.stats <- summary(epa_corp)
head(epa_corp.stats, n = 25)
toks <- tokens(epa_corp, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_numbers = TRUE)
#I added some project-specific stop words here
add_stops <- c(stopwords("en"),"environmental", "justice", "ej", "epa", "public", "comment")
toks1 <- tokens_select(toks, pattern = add_stops, selection = "remove")

```

And now convert to a document-feature matrix

```{r dfm}
dfm_comm<- dfm(toks1, tolower = TRUE)
dfm <- dfm_wordstem(dfm_comm)
dfm <- dfm_trim(dfm, min_docfreq = 2) #remove terms only appearing in one doc (min_termfreq = 10)

print(head(dfm))

#remove rows (docs) with all zeros
sel_idx <- slam::row_sums(dfm) > 0 
dfm <- dfm[sel_idx, ]
#comments_df <- dfm[sel_idx, ]


```

We somehow have to come up with a value for k,the number of latent topics present in the data. How do we do this? There are multiple methods. Let's use what we already know about the data to inform a prediction. The EPA has 9 priority areas: Rulemaking, Permitting, Compliance and Enforcement, Science, States and Local Governments, Federal Agencies, Community-based Work, Tribes and Indigenous People, National Measures. Maybe the comments correspond to those areas?

```{r LDA_modeling}
k <- 9 

topicModel_k9 <- LDA(dfm, k, method="Gibbs", control=list(iter = 500, verbose = 25))
#nTerms(dfm_comm) 

tmResult <- posterior(topicModel_k9)
attributes(tmResult)
#nTerms(dfm_comm)   
beta <- tmResult$terms   # get beta from results
dim(beta)                # K distributions over nTerms(DTM) terms# lengthOfVocab
terms(topicModel_k9, 10)
```

Some of those topics seem related to the cross-cutting and additional topics identified in the EPA's response to the public comments:

1\. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

2.[EJSCREEN](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data)

3\. climate change, climate adaptation and promoting greenhouse gas reductions co-benefits

4\. overburdened communities and other stakeholders to meaningfully, effectively, and transparently participate in aspects of EJ 2020, as well as other agency processes

5\. utilize multiple Federal Advisory Committees to better obtain outside environmental justice perspectives

6\. environmental justice and area-specific training to EPA staff

7\. air quality issues in overburdened communities

So we could guess that there might be a 16 topics (9 priority + 7 additional). Or we could calculate some metrics from the data.

```{r LDA_again}
#
result <- FindTopicsNumber(
  dfm,
  topics = seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 1),
  metrics = c("CaoJuan2009",  "Deveaud2014"),
  method = "Gibbs",
  control = list(seed = 77),
  verbose = TRUE
)

FindTopicsNumber_plot(result)

k <- 7

topicModel_k7 <- LDA(dfm, k, method="Gibbs", control=list(iter = 500, verbose = 25))

tmResult <- posterior(topicModel_k7)
terms(topicModel_k7, 10)
theta <- tmResult$topics
beta <- tmResult$terms
vocab <- (colnames(beta))

```

There are multiple proposed methods for how to measure the best k value. You can [go down the rabbit hole here](#multiple%20proposed%20methods%20for%20measuring%20the%20best%20k%20value.%20You%20can)

```{r top_terms_topic}

comment_topics <- tidy(topicModel_k7, matrix = "beta")

top_terms <- comment_topics %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)

top_terms
```

```{r plot_top_terms}

top_terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()

```

Let's assign names to the topics so we know what we are working with. We can name them by their top terms

```{r topic_names}
top5termsPerTopic <- terms(topicModel_k7, 5)
topicNames <- apply(top5termsPerTopic, 2, paste, collapse=" ")
```

We can explore the theta matrix, which contains the distribution of each topic over each document

```{r topic_dists}
exampleIds <- c(1, 2, 3)
N <- length(exampleIds)

#lapply(epa_corp[exampleIds], as.character) #uncomment to view example text
# get topic proportions form example documents
topicProportionExamples <- theta[exampleIds,]
colnames(topicProportionExamples) <- topicNames
vizDataFrame <- melt(cbind(data.frame(topicProportionExamples), document=factor(1:N)), variable.name = "topic", id.vars = "document")  
ggplot(data = vizDataFrame, aes(topic, value, fill = document), ylab = "proportion") +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +  
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ document, ncol = N)
```

Here's a neat JSON-based model visualizer

```{r LDAvis}
library(LDAvis)
library("tsne")
svd_tsne <- function(x) tsne(svd(x)$u)
json <- createJSON(
  phi = tmResult$terms, 
  theta = tmResult$topics, 
  doc.length = rowSums(dfm), 
  vocab = colnames(dfm), 
  term.frequency = colSums(dfm),
  mds.method = svd_tsne,
  plot.opts = list(xlab="", ylab="")
)
serVis(json)

```

### Assignment:

Either:

A) continue on with the analysis we started:

Run three more models and select the overall best value for k (the number of topics) - include some justification for your selection: theory, FindTopicsNumber() optimization metrics, interpretability, LDAvis

OR

B) use the data you plan to use for your final project:

Prepare the data so that it can be analyzed in the topicmodels package

Run three more models and select the overall best value for k (the number of topics) - include some justification for your selection: theory, FindTopicsNumber() optimization metrics, interpretability, LDAvis
